# Insertion-Sort

A simple insertion sort algorithm using C++.

The practice problem was as follows:
- Turn the code that we wrote for the insertion sort into an inserstionSort function that works for any size of array.

Basically, I asked the user for how elements they'd like to see sorted. Using a dynamic array I allocated the space for the arraySize that the user gave us.
